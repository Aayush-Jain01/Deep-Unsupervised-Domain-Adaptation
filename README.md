# Deep-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation

---

**Abstract**

> It has been well proved that deep networks are effi-
cient at extracting features from a given (source) labeled dataset.
However, it is not always the case that they can generalize well to
other (target) datasets which very often have a different underly-
ing distribution. In this report, we evaluate four different domain
adaptation techniques for image classification tasks. The selected
domain adaptation techniques are unsupervised techniques where
the target dataset will not carry any labels during training
phase. The experiments are conducted on the office-31 dataset.
