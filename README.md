# Deep-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation

---

**Abstract**

> It has been well proved that deep networks are efficient at extracting features from a given (source) labeled dataset.
However, it is not always the case that they can generalize well to other (target) datasets which very often have a different underlying distribution. In this report, we evaluate four different domain adaptation techniques for image classification tasks: **Deep CORAL**, **Deep Domain Confusion (DDC)**, **Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CDAN)** and **CDAN with Entropy Conditioning (CDAN+E)**. 

> The selected domain adaptation techniques are unsupervised techniques where the target dataset will not carry any labels during training phase. The experiments are conducted on the office-31 dataset.
